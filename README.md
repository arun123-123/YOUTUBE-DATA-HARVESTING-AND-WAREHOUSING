Youtube Data harvesting and Warehousing is a project theat intend to povide users with the ability to access and analyse data from numerous YouTube Channels. SQL, MongoDB and Streamlit are used in the project to develop a user-friendlu application that allows users to retrieve, save and query YouTube channel and video data.

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED: This Project requires the following components:

STREAMLIT: Streamlit library was used to create a user-friendly UI that enables users to interact with the programme and carry out data retrieval and analysis operations.
PYTHON: Python is a powerful programming language renowned for being easy to learn and understand. Python is a primary language employed in the project for the development of the complete application, including data retrieval, processing, analysis and visualization.

GOOGLE API CLIENT: The Google API Client library in Python facilitates the communication with different Google API's. Its primary purpose in this project is to interact with You Tube's Data API v3, allowing the retrieval of essential information like channel details, video specifics and comments. By utilizing googleapiclient, developers can easily access and manipulate You Tube's extensive data resources through code.

MONGODB:  MongoDB is built on a scaleout architecture that has become popular with developers of all kinds for developing scalable applications with evolving data schemas. As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store documents.

POSTGRESQL: PostgreSQL is an open-source, advanced and highly scalable database management system(DBMS) known for its reliability and extensive features. It provides a platform for storing and managing structured data, offering support for various data types and advanced SQL capablities.

YOUTUBE DATA SCRAPPING AND ITS ETHICAL PERSPECTIVE:  When engaging in the scraping of YoutTube content, it is crucial to approach it ethically and responsibly. Respecting You Tube's terms and conditions obtaining appropriate authorization and adhering to data protection regulations are fundamental considerations. The collected data must be hndled responsiblity, ensuring privacy, confidentiality and preventing any form of miuse or misrepresentation. Furthermore, it is important to take into account the potential impact on the platform and its community, striving for a fair and sustainable scraping process. By following these ethical guidelines, we can uphold itegrity while extracting valuable insightsd from You Tube data.

REQUIRED LIBRARIES:
1. googleapiclient.discovery
2. streamlit
3. psycopg2
4. pymongo
5. pandas

FEATURES: The Following functions are available in the You Tube Data Harvesting and Warehousing Application. Retrieval of channel and videodata from YouTube using the YouTube API.

Storage of data in a MongoDB database as a data lake.
Migration of data from the data lake to a SQL database for efficient querying and analysis.
Search and retrieval of data from the SQL database using different search options.
